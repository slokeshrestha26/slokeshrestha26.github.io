<p>Hello! Sloke here. I am a final year Electrical Engineering undergraduate student at The University of Texas at Tyler. 
    My interests lie in the intersection of bio-signal processing, applied machine learning, ubiquitous computing, and broadly, Human Computer Interaction.</p>
<p>As an undergraduate, I have worked with <a href="https://www.uttyler.edu/directory/ee/indic.php">Prof. Premananda Indic</a> 
to build machine learning systems to detect risky medical moments in patients. I have also worked with
 <a href="https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/stefanie-mueller.html">Prof. Stefanie Mueller</a> at CSAIL in MIT as a visiting student, 
 where we worked on an Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) toolkit. </p>
