        <strong>Bio:</strong><br>
        Hello! Sloke here. My interests lie in the intersection of bio-signal processing, applied machine learning, ubiquitous computing, and broadly, 
        Human Computer Interaction. I have been working with Prof. Premananda Indic at Center for Health Informatics and Analytics at UT Tyler, and 
        Prof. Stefanie Mueller at <a href="https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/index.html">HCIE lab at CSAIL at MIT.</a> <br><br>

        In my free time, I like to play a bamboo flute. I recently picked up on a swimming hobby. <br><br>
        Feel free to send me an email for possible collaboration, internships, and more!
