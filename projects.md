### EIT Toolkit 
##### 2021 (Summer) - Present

***The goal of the project is to propose an electrical impedance tomography (EIT) toolkit for designing and fabricating health and motion sensing devices.***

I worked on the follow-up project of the Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) kit. I added more features to the EIT mobile visualization API and performed benchmark tests for the image reconstruction algorithm. This project will be presented in UIST 2021.

***The goal of the project was to build a robot that can avoid obstacle using ultrasonic sound emitter and receiver***

In this project, I implemented the circuitry of the robot and programmed the Arduino UNO micro-controller.

***The goal of the project is to develop machine learning algorithms for the detection of carvings and stress in individuals with substance abuse.***

I have been working on developing different machine learning models that can detect stress and drug cravings in patients with substance use disorder. I am also working with [RAE Health](https://www.raehealth.com) to develop a real time intervention system for the treatment of substance use disorder.  <br><br>

***The goal of the project is to understand the physiological mechanisms associated with apnea of prematurity and develop machine learning algorithms for the prediction of life-threatening events in preterm infants.***

I have been working on developing machine learning based risk stratification algorithm for preterm infants. <br><br>
