### Style Transfer Using Diffusion
##### 2023
![Style Transfer Using Diffusion](assets/img/style_transfer_cnh.png)
*We fine tuned stable diffusion to a Calvin and Hobbes dataset. We won the EE 371Q Digital Image Processing Ramâ€™s Horn best project award!! EE 371Q is a famous class taught by [Prof. Alan Bovik](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/alan-bovik) at University of Texas at Austin. <br/><br/>

Technology used: Python, HuggingFace, OpenCV, Numpy*

### LLMs Powered Egocentric Image Annotation Web Application
##### 2023
![LLMs powered Egocentric Image](assets/img/llm_app.png)
*I developed a web application in Flask where a user can log in, and perform studies. The user gets an egocentric image from a camera wearer. Along with the images, the user also gets a list of possible activities that the camera wearer might be performing. The suggestions are powered by large language models (LLMs). The user can select the activity that best describes the image.

Technology used: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MySQL, HuggingFace, Pandas, Numpy*

<p style = "font-size: 0.5em; text-align:center;"> Image reproduced with permission from HCIE Lab</p>

*I worked with researchers at MIT to benchmark different image reconstruction algorithms for electrical impedance tomography (EIT). I implemented image reconstruction algorithms in the toolkit called [EIT-KIT](https://github.com/HCIELab/EIT-kit_open-source). Our team submitted a strong rebuttal at UIST and published it.
Technology used: Python, Swift, XCode, Numpy, Pandas*

### Echolocation Robot 
##### 2020
![Echolocation Robot](assets/img/echo_location_robot.jpeg)

*At UT Tyler, we (team of 3) built a robot that can avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sound emitter and receiver.
Technology used: Arduino UNO, C*
